# isEmailAvailable query

The `isEmailAvailable` query checks whether the specified email has already been used to create a customer account. As of Commerce 2.4.7, by default the query always returns a value of `true` for all email addresses. You can change this behavior by setting the **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Checkout** > **Enable Guest Checkout Login** field in the Admin to **Yes**. However, doing this can expose customer information to unauthenticated users.

When guest checkout logins are enabled, or in versions prior to 2.4.7, a value of `true` indicates the email address is available, and the customer can use the email address to create an account. The value of `false` indicates the email address is not available, and the customer cannot use the email address to create an account.

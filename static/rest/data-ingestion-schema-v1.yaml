  title: Catalog Data Ingestion API
  description: |
    The Catalog Data Ingestion API allows you to create and manage products and price books and directly integrate catalog data with the Commerce catalog service.

    This API provides the following resource collections to create and update catalog data:

    - <strong>[Metadata](#tag/Metadata)</strong>—define and manage product attribute metadata including display settings, search characteristics, filtering options, and sorting rules.
    - <strong>[Products](#tag/Products)</strong>—define and manage catalog items with their attributes (name, description, SKU, images, and variants).
    - <strong>[Price books](#tag/Price-Books)</strong>—define and manage pricing scopes for different customer tiers and markets.
    - <strong>[Prices](#tag/Prices)</strong>—define and manage product SKU prices and their associated price books.

      Manage product attribute definitions including display settings, search behavior, and filtering capabilities.
      These settings control how product attributes appear and function throughout the storefront.

      Product attribute metadata specifies how product attributes are displayed on the storefront.
      For example, you can define a product attribute as searchable, filterable, and sortable.
      You can also define the search type for a product attribute, such as autocomplete or exact match.

  - name: Price Books
    description: |
      Define pricing scopes to manage product prices across different customer tiers and markets. Price books support a hierarchical model, allowing up to three levels of nested child price books under each base price book. Each price book can reference a parent price book, forming a tree structure for pricing scopes.

      The base price book defines the currency for itself and all its child price books. Child price books inherit this currency and cannot override it.

      <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot assign a parent price book to a base price book. Due to the asynchronous nature of the API, this validation is not enforced at runtime. API requests that attempt to set a parent price book for a base price book are ignored.

  - name: Prices
    description: |
      Manage product SKU prices across different price books and customer tiers. Define regular prices and
      special discounts for specific customer segments or markets by specifying a price book id.

      Before creating prices with the Prices API, first create [Price books](#tag/Price-Books). Prices that reference a non-existing price book are ignored.

      <strong>Price lookup logic</strong>

      The product price lookup follows a hierarchical path through price books. The search starts at the specified price book and traverses upward through parent price books until it reaches the root level. A product is not assigned a price if:
        - No price is found in the entire hierarchy
        - The price book specified in a price record has not been created

      <strong>Note:</strong> You cannot define prices for configurable products. Prices for configurable products
       are calculated based on the price of the selected product variant.

      summary: Create product attribute metadata
      description: |
        To ensure product data is indexed for discovery, create or replace existing product attribute metadata resources before creating products.

        For each Commerce project, you must define metadata for the following attributes for each catalog source (`locale`):
          - `sku`
          - `name`
          - `description`
          - `shortDescription`
          - `price`

        Also, you can define metadata for custom attributes.

        When creating product attribute metadata:
          - Each product attribute requires a unique `code` and `source`.
          - Use the `dataType` field to define the data type for the product attribute.
          - Use the `visibleIn` field to define where the product attribute is displayed on the storefront.
          - Use the `filterable`, `sortable`, and `searchable` fields to define how the product attribute
            is used for filtering, sorting, and searching.
          - Use the `searchWeight` field to define the search weight for the product attribute.
          - Use the `searchTypes` field to define the search type for the product attribute.

        To update existing product attribute metadata, use the update operation.

      summary: Create or replace products
      description: |
        You can create different types of products, such as simple products and configurable products.

        When creating products:
         - Each product requires a unique SKU identifier.
         - Products must have a defined catalog source, for example `locale`.
         - Add values for the required `name`, `slug`, and `status` fields.
         - Define optional fields such as descriptions, images, and custom attributes as needed.
         - Use the `links` field to define relationships between products, such as linking a product variant to its parent
         configurable product.
         - You can create multiple products in a single request, and also create product variants for configurable products in the same request.

        <h3 id="simpleProducts">Simple Products</h3>
        Create products or replace existing products with specified `sku` and `source` values.

        Use the <strong>[update operation](#operation/updateProducts)</strong> to modify values for an existing product.

        <h3>Configurable Products</h3>
        A configurable product is a parent product that allows customers to select from multiple predefined attributes such as color, size, and material.
        Each unique combination of these attribute values (for example, `color=green`, `size=large`) represents a product variant.

        Each variant is treated as a distinct child product with its own SKU, price, and inventory. These variants are stored as separate entities in the database and linked to the parent configurable product.

        The configurable product itself acts as a container or abstraction layer, enabling a unified frontend experience while maintaining
        granular control over each variant on the backend.

        To create a configurable product, you need the following:

        * <strong>Product attributes</strong>—<a href="#operation/createProductMetadata">Create product attributes</a> (for example, "color", "size")
        that will be used to differentiate product variants. These attributes must be registered in the system before they can be referenced in
        product definitions.

        * <strong>Configurable product</strong>—Define the parent product and include a
          [configurations](#operation/createProducts!path=configurations&t=request) array that specifies the selectable options
          and maps each option to a set of possible values. Each value must include a
          [variantReferenceId](#operation/createProducts!path=configurations/values/variantReferenceId&t=request),
          which links to a specific variant.

        * <strong>Product variants</strong>—Define a product variant for each valid combination of attribute values. Each variant must:
          * Include relevant attribute values in an [attributes](#operation/createProducts!path=attributes&t=request) array.
          * Reference the parent configurable product using variantReferenceId.
          * Include a [links](#operation/createProducts!path=links&t=request) array with a link of type `VARIANT_OF` pointing to the configurable product.

          For example:

          <pre>
          {
            "sku": "pants-red-32",
            "attributes": [
              {
                "code": "color",
                "values": ["Red"],
                "variantReferenceId": "pants-color-red"
              }
            ],
            "links": [
              {
                "type": "VARIANT_OF",
                "sku": "pants"
              }
            ]
          }
        </pre>

          Each product variant links back to the configurable product through its `variantReferenceId`, which corresponds to specific `configurations[].values[].variantReferenceId` in the configurable product.

          To unassign a product variant from a configurable product, do one of the following:
          - Use [Delete Product API](#operation/deleteProducts) to delete the product variant.
          - Use [Update Product API](#operation/updateProducts) to set the ["variantReferenceId"](#operation/createProducts!path=attributes/variantReferenceId&t=request) to `null` and unassign the product variant from the configurable product by removing the ["links"](#operation/createProducts!path=links&t=request) association.

        <h3>Bundle Products</h3>

        A bundle product combines several simple products into one sellable unit. Items within the bundle can be categorized into logical groups like `tops`, `bottoms`, and `accessories`.
        Each group can have multiple items, and shoppers can select items from each group to create a customized bundle.

        To create a bundle product, you need the following:

        * <strong>Bundle product</strong>—[Define the parent product](#operation/createProducts) and include a [bundles](#operation/createProducts!path=bundles) array that
        specifies the groups and items included in the bundle. Each group must define:
          * `group` - Name of the group (for example, "tops", "bottoms")
          * `required` - Whether a selection from this group is mandatory
          * `multiSelect` - Whether multiple items can be selected
          * `items` - List of products that can be selected from this group

        * <strong>Simple products</strong>—Define each simple product to include in the bundle. Each product must:
          * Include a [links](#operation/createProducts!path=links) array with a link of type `IN_BUNDLE` pointing to the bundle product
          * Be created separately using the [create product API](#operation/createProducts)

        <strong>Note:</strong> A simple product can be included only once in each bundle.
        If the same item is specified in multiple groups, the API returns a `Duplicate SKU found in bundle items` error.

        To update a bundle product, do one of the following:
        * Use the [Update products API](#operation/updateProducts) to modify the groups and items in the bundle
        * Use the [Delete products API](#operation/deleteProducts) to remove items from the bundle

      summary: Delete price books
      description: |
        When you delete a price book, all its child price books and all prices assigned to the `priceBookId` and its children are also deleted.

        If a price book is deleted by mistake, you have up to one week to restore the deleted price books and their associated prices. Restoring is done by recreating the top-level parent price book that was deleted, using the same payload submitted in the original create price book request. The state of the price books and prices are restored to the status and price values assigned when the price book was deleted.

      description: |
        Create or replace existing product prices.

        <h3>Configurable Products</h3>
        Because configurable product price is calculated based on the price of the selected product variant, you don't need to send price
        data for configurable product skus. Sending price data for these skus can cause incorrect price calculations.

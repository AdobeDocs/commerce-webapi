# REST API Overview

The [REST API documentation][] describes the REST APIs that are available on the latest release of Adobe Commerce.

This documentation uses [ReDoc][] to organize and present schema files that follow an [Open-API specification][].
The schema files this tool uses represent the state of the code at the time the file was generated.

You can also create a dynamic REST API documentation set on your server with live data.
Commerce uses [Swagger][] to display REST APIs for all installed products and allows you to try out the APIs.
For more information, see [Generate local REST API reference](./quick-reference/generate-local.md).

# Payment services minicart workflow

These steps describe the additional flow of requests and responses required to place an order after [adding a product to your cart](../tutorials/checkout/add-product-to-cart.md) with the [Payment Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/payment-services/guide-overview.html) solution enabled.

## Minicart workflow

1. Run the [`getPaymentConfig`](../schema/checkout/queries/get-payment-config.md) query to fetch the payment configuration needed to render details about PayPal components, such as hosted fields, smart buttons, and Apple Pay.

1. Adobe Commerce returns payment configuration information.

1. Run [`createPaymentOrder`](../schema/checkout/mutations/create-payment-order.md) to begin the authorization process.

1. Commerce forwards the request to PayPal.

1. PayPal returns an `id` value.

1. Commerce generates an `order_id` and forwards the value in the `mp_order_id` field and in the PayPal response in the `id` field.

1. Run the [`syncPaymentOrder`](../schema/checkout/mutations/sync-payment-order.md) mutation to get payment details and update the quote with shipping, billing, email, and phone number details.

1. Commerce returns details about the payment order.

1. Run the [`setShippingMethodsOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-shipping-method.md)mutation to define the delivery methods for your order.

1. Commerce returns details about the delivery methods for your order.

1. Run the [`placeOrder`](../schema/cart/mutations/place-order.md) mutation.

1. Commerce sends an authorization request to PayPal.

1. PayPal returns the result to Commerce.

1. Commerce creates an order.

## `setPaymentMethodOnCartInput` object

For the PayPal Smart Buttons and Apple Pay payment methods, you do not need to run the [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-payment-method.md) mutation. The hosted fields payment method requires that you run the mutation only if one of the following conditions are true:

* You intend to vault a card by setting `is_active_payment_token_enabler` to `true`.

* You have a stored payment method checkout where you intend to use a stored card by setting a `public_hash` value.

In these cases, the payment_method object must contain a `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields` object.

### `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields` object

The `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields` can contain the following attributes:

Attribute |  Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`cardBin` | String | Card bin number
`cardExpiryMonth` | String | Expiration month of the card
`cardExpiryYear` | String | Expiration year of the card
`cardLast4` | String | Last four digits of the card
`holderName` | String | Name on card
`is_active_payment_token_enabler` | Boolean | Indicates whether a customer-entered credit/debit card should be tokenized for later usage. The default value is false. Required only if vaulting is enabled for Payment Services payment integration
`payments_order_id` | String | The unique order ID generated in Commerce if Payment Services is enabled after PayPal returns the `paypal_order_id`
`paypal_order_id` | String | The unique order ID generated by PayPal when receiving the authorization request
`payment_source` | String | The payment source for the payment method

### `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation example

The following example sets the payment method to `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields`:

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
    setPaymentMethodOnCart ( input: {
      cart_id: "uocGxUi5H97XFAMhY3s66q4aFYG3Bmdr",
      payment_method: {
        code: "payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields",
        payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields: {
          payment_source: "cc",
          payments_order_id: "mp-order-a4babd34-13d3-4ac0-b1b0-109bb7be1574",
          paypal_order_id: "9R90936863877801D",
          is_active_payment_token_enabler: true
        }
      }
    }
    ) {
       cart {
         id
         selected_payment_method {
           code
         }
       }
    }
  }
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "setPaymentMethodOnCart": {
      "cart": {
        "id": "r8TKHa58b7Y8VaZHLyABNxrEdS8hJJTZ",
        "selected_payment_method": {
          "code": "payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

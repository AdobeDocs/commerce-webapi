# Integrate with the CompanyCredit module

Company credit allows company members to purchase items on credit. This is a feature specific to <Vars.sitedatavarb2b/> that is used only for transactions between companies. The seller allocates an amount (or the credit limit) to a company and then company members can purchase items using this amount with the Payment on Account method. The credit amount used by a company is sent to the seller offline. Then the seller creates a Reimburse transaction in the system to adjust the company balance.

The following diagram illustrates the process flow of orders using the Payment on Account method.

# Attributes

The attributes queries allow you to retrieve values stored as custom and [Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/components/attributes/) attributes. Custom attributes are those added on behalf of a merchant. For example, a merchant might need to add attributes to describe products, such as shape or volume. EAV attributes are defined by the system.

The attributes mutations allow you to set custom attributes on entities such as carts, orders, and invoices. These custom attributes operate independently of the EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) attributes, which are defined in the Admin. They do not apply to products, categories, or customers.

# Negotiable quote (B2B)

Company users (buyers) and merchants (sellers) use negotiable quotes to manage the negotiation process for an order. Although the negotiation process can be complex, the basic steps are as follows:

* The buyer adds items to the cart and initiates a negotiable quote.

* The seller reviews the request and begins the negotiation process.

* When the buyer and seller agree to terms, the buyer begins the checkout process.

The [_B2B for Adobe Commerce Guide_](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/quotes/quotes.html?lang=en) describes the negotiation process in detail.

The Adobe Commerce GraphQL APIs provide coverage for buyer actions only. You can use [REST endpoints](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/rest/b2b/negotiable-quote/) to integrate seller actions.

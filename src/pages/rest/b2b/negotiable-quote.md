# Integrate with the NegotiableQuote module

Negotiable quotes are a mechanism that allows a company user (buyer) and a seller (admin user) to negotiate product and/or shipping prices before the company user places an order. The negotiable quote functionality is available for companies only.

The negotiable quote lifecycle includes a number of stages, as shown in the following diagram.

The quoting process itself can be a continuous process, with a number of repeating cycles until the agreement is reached.

-  The buyer creates and submits a negotiable quote
-  The seller reviews and modifies or declines the quote
-  The buyer reviews the seller's counteroffer
-  Upon agreement, the buyer begins the checkout process and the system converts the negotiable quote into an order

A negotiable quote can also be initiated by a seller. In this case, the negotiation lifecycle includes the following stages:

- The seller creates and submits a negotiable quote
- The buyer reviews and modifies the quote, or begins the checkout process
- The seller reviews and modifies or declines the quote
- Upon agreement, the buyer begins the checkout process and the system converts the negotiable quote into an order

You cannot negotiate prices on individual items.

## Quote statuses

The quote life cycle is managed via quote statuses. The quoting interface allows both a seller and a buyer to manage items in the quote (add, delete, change quantity) as well as make an offer (or request a quote) for items and/or for shipping.

The negotiated price set in the negotiable quote is exactly the price that will be applied on a quote during checkout, order generation, and invoice generation.

Ordered | The buyer has purchased the quote, and Adobe Commerce converts the quote to an order. Neither the seller nor the buyer can edit the quote. | View

Declined | The seller has declined the quote. All custom pricing (if any) is removed from the quote. In admin panel, the quote is locked for editing.                                                                                                 | View

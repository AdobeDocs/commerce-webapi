# createCompany mutation

The `createCompany` mutation creates a company at the request of either a customer or a guest. The company definition includes the first name, last name, and email address of the company administrator. The email address assigned to the account cannot already exist in the system. Therefore, a customer attempting to create a company cannot use the same email address they used to log in to the storefront.

The company administrator cannot log in or perform additional company-related tasks until an administrator approves the request to create a company.

This mutation requires a valid [customer authentication token](../../../customer/mutations/generate-token.md).

## Syntax

```graphql
mutation {
  createCompany(
    input: CompanyCreateInput!
  ) {
    CreateCompanyOutput
  }
}
```

## Reference

The [`createCompany`](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql-api/index.html#mutation-createCompany) reference provides detailed information about the types and fields defined in this mutation.

# Live Search

Live Search is a set of standalone packages for Adobe Commerce that replaces the standard search capabilities. It provides GraphQL functionality that is currently separate from the built-in GraphQL functionality provided in Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source. Live Search GraphQL requires connecting to a different endpoint and specifying a different set of HTTP headers.

You can connect to the Live Search GraphQL endpoint to test sample queries using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in two ways:

-  Through the GraphQL Playground IDE embedded in the Commerce Admin. The embedded IDE manages the endpoint URL and required HTTP headers. To access this IDE, go to **Marketing** > SEO & Search > **Live Search**.

-  Through a standalone version of GraphQL Playground, or any other IDE, such as GraphiQL or Postman. In these applications you must specify the endpoint URL and provide a set of HTTP headers for each call.

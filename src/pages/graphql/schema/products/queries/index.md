# Product queries

This section describes the following queries:

* [`categories`](categories.md)
* [`category`](category.md)
* [`categoryList`](category-list.md)
* [`compareList`](compare-list.md)
* [`productReviewRatingsMetadata`](product-review-ratings-metadata.md)
* [`products`](products.md)
* [`route`](route.md)
* [`urlResolver`](url-resolver.md)

Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service (SaaS) does not support the `products` or `categories` query. Use the Catalog Service [`products` query](../../catalog-service/queries/products.md) or [categories query](../../catalog-service/queries/categories.md) instead. If you are migrating from PaaS to SaaS, you must update your applications to use the Catalog Service queries.

# Wish list

Use the wish list mutations to manage wish lists and their contents. `WishlistItemInterface` and its implementations return details about individual items in a wish list.

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text" />

The `wishlist` query has been deprecated. Wish list information is now provided by the [customer](../customer/queries/customer.md) query.

# cancelOrder mutation

The `cancelOrder` mutation allows a customer to cancel an order, passing its identifier and a cancellation reason.

A customer can cancel an order only if the following conditions are true:

 * The customer has previously placed the order.
 * The `order_cancellation_enabled` configuration setting is `true`.
 * The order has a status of **RECEIVED**, **PENDING**, or **PROCESSING**.

If the customer has been charged for the order, the order is placed in the CLOSED state, and the customer will be issued a refund. Otherwise, the status of the order is set to CANCELED.

The mutation returns an error if the order cannot be cancelled.

## Syntax

`mutation: {cancelOrder(input: CanceOrderInput!) {CancelOrderOutput}}`

# Gift registry

Once gift registry functionality is enabled and configured from the Admin, customers use the following workflow to create registries:

1. The customer creates a gift registry from their account for an upcoming occasion and completes the required fields in each section of the gift registry. After adding items to the registry, it can be shared with friends and family.

1. The customer shares their registry. A link to the gift registry is included in each invitation. If Gift Registry Search is enabled in the store, shoppers can search for specific gift registries by name, email address, or gift registry ID.

1. Invitation recipients place orders. Those who receive an invitation or information about the registry can place an order for any item directly from the gift registry. As items are sold, Adobe Commerce updates the gift registry item counts, and notifies the gift registry owner.

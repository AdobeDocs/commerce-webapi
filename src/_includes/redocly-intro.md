This documentation provides descriptions of all the Adobe Commerce REST API endpoints. These three different REST APIs (Admin, Customer, and Guest) determine which endpoints are accessible. Select the Adobe Commerce version and corresponding API that you want to view the documentation for.

You can also [generate a local API reference](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/rest/quick-reference/generate-local/) based on your own Adobe Commerce configuration, which allows you to see API documentation for your specific Adobe Commerce modules, third-party modules, and extension attributes.

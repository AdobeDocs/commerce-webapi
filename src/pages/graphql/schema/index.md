# GraphQL schema

We have reorganized the Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source GraphQL reference documentation to make it easier to find related queries, mutations, interfaces, and other data types. Use the left navigation to review usage information and examples for each entity in the Commerce schema.

The Catalog Service, Live Search, and Product Recommendations services have schemas that are independent from the core schema for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source. You can find the schema reference documentation and examples for these services in [Storefront Services GraphQL](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/graphql/).

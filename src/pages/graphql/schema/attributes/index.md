# Attributes

The attributes queries allow you to retrieve values stored as custom and [Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)()] attributes. Custom attributes are those added on behalf of a merchant. For example, a merchant might need to add attributes to describe products, such as shape or volume. EAV attributes are defined by the system.

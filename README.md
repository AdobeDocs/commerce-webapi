## GraphQL API reference generator

The GraphQL API reference is generated using an open-source tool [SpectaQL](https://github.com/anvilco/spectaql). The data required for the generator is located at the `spectaql` directory:

- `adobe-theme`: [custom theme](https://github.com/anvilco/spectaql/blob/main/examples/themes/README.md).
- `config.yml`: [configuration file](https://github.com/anvilco/spectaql#yaml-options).
- `schema.json`: the GraphQL schema extracted from the Adobe Commerce (B2B) instance.

The resulted GraphQL API reference lives in the `static/graphql-api/` directory.
It is embedded into the `/graphql/reference` page using the `frameSrc` feature on the DevSite.

To rebuild the GraphQL API reference after any updates, run:

```shell
yarn build:spectaql
```

To run SpectaQL in the development mode:

```shell
yarn dev:spectaql
```

### How to get the schema

The website in the public directory was generated for the Adobe Commerce with B2B instance from GraphQL Schema 'schema.json'. The schema was retrieved using the apollo-cli tool:

```shell
npx apollo-cli download-schema $ENDPOINT_URL --output schema.json
```

where `$ENDPOINT_URL` is a placeholder for a URL's endpoint.

# Assign companies to a shared catalog

A shared catalog must be assigned to one or more companies before it can be accessed by the company users.

**Service name:**

`sharedCatalogCompanyManagementV1`

**REST endpoints:**

```terminal
POST /V1/sharedCatalog/:sharedCatalogId/assignCompanies
POST /V1/sharedCatalog/:sharedCatalogId/unassignCompanies
GET  /V1/sharedCatalog/:sharedCatalogId/companies
```

Although you can specify other parameters defined within a `categories` object, the `id` is the only one used to assign or unassign a category to a shared catalog.

`id` | The company ID number | integer | Required to assign or unassign a company to a shared catalog

## Assign companies to shared catalog

This action works as an update. It does not replace companies that have already been assigned.

If a specified company is already assigned to a different shared catalog, this request unassigns the company from the previous catalog and assigns to the new one.

**Sample usage:**

`POST <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/assignCompanies`

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="2" languages="JSON, JSON" />

#### Payload

```json
{
  "companies": [
    {
      "id": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Response

```json
// `true`, indicating the request was successful
```

## Unassign companies from a shared catalog

When you unassign a company from a custom catalog, the system automatically assigns this company to the public shared catalog. You cannot unassign a company from the public catalog.

**Sample usage:**

`POST <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/unassignCompanies`

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="2" languages="JSON, JSON" />

#### Payload

```json
{
  "companies": [
    {
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Response

```json
// `true`, indicating the request was successful
```

## List the shared catalog companies

The `GET` call returns an array of company IDs.

**Sample Usage:**

`GET <host>/rest/<store_code>/V1/sharedCatalog/2/companies`

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="2" languages="JSON, JSON" />

#### Payload

```json
// Not applicable
```

#### Response

```json
"[\"1\",\"2\"]"
```

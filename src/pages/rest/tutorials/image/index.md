# Add and manage product images tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Adobe Commerce REST APIs to add, list, update, and delete product images.

In this tutorial, we will add an image to a product, list all available images, update an existing image with a new one and delete an image.

This **4-step tutorial** generally takes **30 minutes**.

## Before you begin

*  Install an Adobe Commerce instance with sample data.

*  Install a REST client. We will use _Postman_ in this tutorial.

*  Generate an admin access token. It will be used for image managing API calls. See [Token-based authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-token/) for more information.

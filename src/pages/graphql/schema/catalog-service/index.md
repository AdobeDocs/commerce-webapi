# Catalog Service for Adobe Commerce

The Catalog Service for Adobe Commerce extension contributes to a services-only GraphQL schema that contains queries that return specialized catalog data that is not available in the core schema. The queries in this schema allow Commerce merchants to quickly and fully render product-related content on the storefront, including product detail pages and product list pages.

Catalog Service provides the following queries:

*  [`products`](queries/products.md)
*  [`refineProduct`](queries/refine-product.md)

It also extends the Live Search [`productSearch`](queries/product-search.md) query to return product view data.

You can optionally implement [API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/) to integrate the two Adobe Commerce GraphQL systems with private and third-party APIs and other software interfaces using Adobe Developer. The mesh can be configured to ensure calls routed to each endpoint contain the correct authorization information in the headers.

The [Catalog Service Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/catalog-service/overview.html) describes the architecture and implementation of this product.

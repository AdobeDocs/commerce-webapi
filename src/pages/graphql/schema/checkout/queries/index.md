# Checkout queries

The checkout queries gather data necessary for completing the checkout process. Each has a limited scope:

* [`checkoutAgreements`](agreements.md) is applicable only if the [**Enable Terms and Conditions** option](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/point-of-purchase/checkout/checkout-process.html) has been enabled in the Admin.

* [`customerPaymentTokens`](customer-payment-tokens.md) retrieves the customer's stored payment information when the [**Enable Vault for Card Payments**](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/config/sales/payment-methods/braintree.html) option has been enabled for Braintree.

* [`getHostedProUrl`](get-hosted-pro-url.md) is required for the PayPal Website Payments Pro Hosted Solution payment method.

* [`getPayflowLinkToken`](get-payflow-link-token.md) is required for PayPal Payflow transactions.

If you have installed [Payment Services for Adobe Commerce](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/magento-payment-services.html) 2.3.0 or higher, you can also use the following queries:

* [`getPaymentConfig`](get-payment-config.md)

* [`getPaymentOrder`](get-payment-order.md)

* [`getPaymentSDK`](get-payment-sdk.md)

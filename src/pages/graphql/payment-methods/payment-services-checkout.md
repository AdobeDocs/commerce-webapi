# Payment services as a payment method during a checkout authorization

Payment Services for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source is your turnkey self-service solution, including sandbox testing and a simple setup, for providing robust and secure payment processing for your Commerce websites.

These steps describe the flow of requests and responses required to complete a typical [checkout](../tutorials/checkout/index.md) authorization with [Payment Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/payment-services/guide-overview.html) solution enabled.

## Checkout workflow

![Payment Services sequence diagram](../../_images/graphql/payment-services.svg)

1. Run `getPaymentConfig` to fetch the payment configuration to retrieve and render details about PayPal components, such as hosted fields, smart buttons, and Apple Pay.

1. Commerce returns payment configuration information.

1. Run `setPaymentMethodOnCart` to [set the payment method](../tutorials/checkout/set-payment-method.md).

1. Adobe Commerce returns a `Cart` object.

1. Run `createPaymentOrder` to begin the authorization process.

1. Commerce forwards the request to PayPal.

1. PayPal returns an `id` value.

1. Adobe Commerce generates a `order_id` and forwards the value in the `mp_order_id` field and the PayPal response in the `id` field.

1. (Optional) If hosted fields and the Signifyd integration are enabled, run `getPaymentOrder`.

1.  (Optional) Adobe Commerce returns details about the payment order.

1.  Run `placeOrder`.

1.  Commerce sends an authorization request to PayPal.

1.  PayPal returns the result to Commerce.

1.  Commerce creates an order.

## `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation

When you set the payment method to Payment Services in the [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-payment-method.md) mutation, the `payment_method` object must contain a `Payment Services` object.

### Payment Services object

The `Payment Services` object must contain the following attributes:

Attribute |  Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`payment_source` | String! | The identifiable payment source for the payment method
`payments_order_id` | String! | The unique order id generated in Commerce if Payment Services is enabled after PayPal returns the `paypal_order_id`. Required field for sale transactions
`paypal_order_id` | String! | The unique order id generated by PayPal when receiving the authorization request. Required field for sale transactions
`is_active_payment_token_enabler` | Boolean! | States whether a customer-entered credit/debit card should be tokenized for later usage. Required only if Vaulting is enabled for Payment Services payment integration
`location` | String | Defines the origin location for that payment request. Required field for sale transactions

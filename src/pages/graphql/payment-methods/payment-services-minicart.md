## `setPaymentMethodOnCartInput` object

When you set the payment method to Payment Services in the [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-payment-method.md) mutation, the `setPaymentMethodOnCartInput` object must contain specific `Payment Services` attributes for the supported payment methods.

### Payment Services object

The `Payment Services` object must contain the following attributes:

Attribute |  Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`is_active_payment_token_enabler` | Boolean! | States whether a customer-entered credit/debit card should be tokenized for later usage. Required only if vaulting is enabled for Payment Services payment integration. The possible values are `True` or `False`
`location` | PaymentLocation! | The origin location for that payment request. The possible values are PRODUCT_DETAIL, MINICART, CART, CHECKOUT, ADMIN
`payments_order_id` | String! | The unique order ID generated in Commerce if Payment Services is enabled after PayPal returns the `paypal_order_id`
`paypal_order_id` | String! | The unique order ID generated by PayPal when receiving the authorization request
`payment_source` | String! | The identifiable payment source for the payment method

# Checkout mutations

The checkout mutations create or otherwise manage the payment tokens needed to complete checkout for an online payment method.

If you have installed [Payment Services for Adobe Commerce](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/magento-payment-services.html) 2.3.0 or higher, you can use the following mutations during checkout:

* [`createPaymentOrder`](../../../payment-services-extension/mutations/create-payment-order.md)

* [`syncPaymentOrder`](../../../payment-services-extension/mutations/sync-payment-order.md)

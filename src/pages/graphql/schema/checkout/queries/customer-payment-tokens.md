# customerPaymentTokens query

When the [vault](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/payments-integrations/vault/) feature is supported by a payment integration and enabled, customers have the option during checkout to save their credit card information. (Braintree supports the vault feature. Third-party payment integrations may support this feature as well.) During subsequent checkouts, the customer is presented with a list of saved payment options. If Instant Purchase is enabled, customers can even by-pass the two-step checkout process and place the order from the product page.

The `customerPaymentTokens` query returns an array of stored payment methods. Use the [deletePaymentToken mutation](../mutations/delete-payment-token.md) to delete a payment token from the system.

You must specify the customer's authorization token in the header of the call.

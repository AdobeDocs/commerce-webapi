# Company (B2B)

The Company component is the key entity within B2B on which all other features are in some way dependent. It allows joining multiple buyers that belong to the same company into a single company account (or corporate account). The company administrator is able to build the company structure (divisions, subdivisions, and users) in the appropriate hierarchy and provide different user roles and permissions to the company members. This hierarchy allows the company administrator to control user activity for the company account: ordering, quoting, purchasing, access to company credit information or profile, and so on. A seller can configure how the buying company operates on the website, including the payment methods, pricing levels, the ability to negotiate prices, and the ability to create requisition lists.

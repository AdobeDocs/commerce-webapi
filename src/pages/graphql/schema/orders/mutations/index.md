# Orders mutations

With the exception of the [`reorderItems` mutation](reorder-items.md), the Orders mutations create and manage returns (RMAs). Use the [`requestReturn` mutation](request-return.md) to initiate an RMA. You can subsequently add or remove shipment tracking information or add a comment to the RMA.

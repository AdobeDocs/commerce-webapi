# createCustomerAddress mutation

Use the `createCustomerAddress` mutation to create the customer's address.

To return or modify information about a customer, we recommend you use customer tokens in the header of your GraphQL calls. However, you also can use [session authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-session).

## Syntax

`mutation: {createCustomerAddress(input: CustomerAddressInput!) {CustomerAddress}}`

## Example usage

<TabsBlock orientation="horizontal" slots="heading, content" repeat="2" theme="light"/>

# updateCustomerAddress mutation

Use the `updateCustomerAddress` mutation to update the customer's address.

To return or modify information about a customer, we recommend you use customer tokens in the header of your GraphQL calls. However, you also can use [session authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-session).

## Syntax

`mutation: {updateCustomerAddress(id: Int!, input: CustomerAddressInput) {CustomerAddress}}`

## Reference

The [`updateCustomerAddress`](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql-api/index.html#mutation-updateCustomerAddress) reference provides detailed information about the types and fields defined in this mutation.

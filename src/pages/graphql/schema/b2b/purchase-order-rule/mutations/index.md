# Purchase order approval rule (B2B) mutations

B2B for Adobe Commerce provides mutations to manage purchase order approval rules:

* `createPurchaseOrderApprovalRule`
* `deletePurchaseOrderApprovalRule`
* `updatePurchaseOrderApprovalRule`

The `validatePurchaseOrders` mutation allows an approver to manually validate purchase orders when automatic validation fails unexpectedly.

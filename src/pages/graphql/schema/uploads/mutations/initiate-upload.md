# initiateUpload mutation

The `initiateUpload` mutation starts the file upload process by generating a presigned URL for uploading a file to an Amazon S3 bucket. This mutation requires the file name (`key`) and media resource type (`media_resource_type`) as input parameters. The `key` value cannot contain slashes. The following media resource types are supported:

* `CUSTOMER_ATTRIBUTE_FILE`
* `CUSTOMER_ATTRIBUTE_IMAGE`
* `NEGOTIABLE_QUOTE_ATTACHMENT`

When you call this mutation, Commerce uses the AWS SDK to create a presigned URL that allows the client to upload the file directly to a temporary location in the S3 bucket. The presigned URL is valid for a limited time, specified by the `expires_at` field in the response.

The response includes the presigned URL, a unique key for the file, and an expiration time for the URL. The `key` is a hashed value that uniquely identifies the file in the S3 bucket. The client uses the presigned URL to upload the file using a standard HTTP PUT request.

Use the `upload_url` from the response to PUT the file directly to S3. See [Upload files to Amazon S3](../index.md) for an example curl.

After the file is successfully uploaded, use the [`finishUpload` mutation](finish-upload.md) to complete the upload process.

## Syntax

mutation {
    initiateUpload(input: initiateUploadInput!): initiateUploadOutput

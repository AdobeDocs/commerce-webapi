# Catalog Service queries

Catalog Service provides the following queries:

*  [`categories`](categories.md)
*  [`products`](products.md)
*  [`refineProduct`](refine-product.md)
*  [`variants`](product-variants.md)

It also extends the Live Search [`productSearch`](../../live-search/queries/product-search.md) query to return product view data.

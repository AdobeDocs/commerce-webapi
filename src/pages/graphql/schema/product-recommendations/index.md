# Product Recommendations

Product Recommendations is a service that suggests products based on the browsing patterns of other shoppers. Product recommendations are surfaced on the storefront as units with labels, such as "Customers who viewed this product also viewed" or "Customers who bought this product also bought". You can create, manage, and deploy recommendations across your store views directly from the Adobe Commerce Admin.

The `recommendations` query returns recommended products based on the provided SKU.

The schema documented here is autogenerated from an instance of Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service.

The base format for Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service REST endpoint URLs is:

`https://<region>.api.commerce.adobe.com/<tenant-id>/<endpoint>`

The URL does not include `/rest` or the store view code. You must use the `Store` HTTP header to set the store scope.

See the <a href="https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/rest/" target="_blank">REST Overview</a> for more details about the URL structure and authentication.

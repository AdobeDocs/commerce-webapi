# negotiableQuotes query

The `negotiableQuotes` query returns a list of negotiable quotes that can be viewed by the logged-in customer, including quotes created by the customer or by subordinates in the company hierarchy.

This query requires a valid [customer authentication token](../../../customer/mutations/generate-token.md).

## Syntax

    negotiableQuotes(
        filter: NegotiableQuoteFilterInput,
        pageSize: Int = 20,
        currentPage: Int = 1
    ): NegotiableQuotesOutput
}
```

## Example usage

The following example returns general information about the negotiable quotes containing the string `request` that are accessible to the company user. The results are sorted by negotiable quote name, listed in ascending order.

**Request:**

```graphql
query {
  negotiableQuotes(filter: { name:
    { match: "request" }
    })

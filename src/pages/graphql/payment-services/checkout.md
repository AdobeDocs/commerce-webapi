# Payment services during a checkout authorization

[Payment Services for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/payment-services/guide-overview.html) is your turnkey self-service solution, including sandbox testing and a simple setup, for providing robust and secure payment processing for your Commerce websites.

These steps describe the flow of requests and responses required to complete a typical [checkout](../tutorials/checkout/index.md) authorization with Payment Services enabled.

## Checkout workflow

1. Run the [`getPaymentConfig`](../schema/checkout/queries/get-payment-config.md) query to fetch the payment configuration needed to render details about PayPal components, such as hosted fields, smart buttons, and Apple Pay.

1. Commerce returns payment configuration information.

1. Run [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-payment-method.md) to [set the payment method](../tutorials/checkout/set-payment-method.md).

1. Adobe Commerce returns a `Cart` object.

1. Run [`createPaymentOrder`](../schema/checkout/mutations/create-payment-order.md) to begin the authorization process.

1. Commerce forwards the request to PayPal.

1. PayPal returns an `id` value.

1. Adobe Commerce generates a `order_id` and forwards the value in the `mp_order_id` field and the PayPal response in the `id` field.

1. (Optional) If hosted fields and the Signifyd integration are enabled, run [`getPaymentOrder`](../schema/checkout/queries/get-payment-order.md).

1. (Optional) Adobe Commerce returns details about the payment order.

1. Run [`placeOrder`](../schema/cart/mutations/place-order.md).

1. Commerce sends an authorization request to PayPal.

1. PayPal returns the result to Commerce.

1. Commerce creates an order.

## `setPaymentMethodOnCartInput` object

For the PayPal Smart Buttons and Apple Pay payment methods, you do not need to run the [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-payment-method.md) mutation. The hosted fields payment method requires that you run the mutation only if one of the following conditions are true:

* You intend to vault a card by setting `is_active_payment_token_enabler` to `true`.

* You have a stored payment method checkout where you intend to use a stored card by setting a `public_hash` value.

In these cases, the payment_method object must contain a `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields` object.

### `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields` object

The `payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields` can contain the following attributes:

Attribute |  Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`cardBin` | String | Card bin number
`cardExpiryMonth` | String | Expiration month of the card
`cardExpiryYear` | String | Expiration year of the card
`cardLast4` | String | Last four digits of the card
`holderName` | String | Name on card
`is_active_payment_token_enabler` | Boolean | Indicates whether a customer-entered credit/debit card should be tokenized for later usage. The default value is false. Required only if vaulting is enabled for Payment Services payment integration
`payments_order_id` | String | The unique order ID generated in Commerce if Payment Services is enabled after PayPal returns the `paypal_order_id`
`paypal_order_id` | String | The unique order ID generated by PayPal when receiving the authorization request
`payment_source` | String | The payment source for the payment method

### `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation example

The following example shows the `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation constructed for the PayPal Hosted Fields payment method.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
    setPaymentMethodOnCart ( input: {
      cart_id: "uocGxUi5H97XFAMhY3s66q4aFYG3Bmdr",
      payment_method: {
        code: "payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields",
        payment_services_paypal_hosted_fields: {
          payment_source: "cc",
          payments_order_id: "mp-order-a4babd34-13d3-4ac0-b1b0-109bb7be1574",
          paypal_order_id: "9R90936863877801D",
          is_active_payment_token_enabler: true
        }
      }
    }
    ) {
       cart {
         id
         selected_payment_method {
           code
         }
       }
    }
  } 
```

**Response:**

  "data": {
    "setPaymentMethodOnCart": {
      "cart": {
        "id": "r8TKHa58b7Y8VaZHLyABNxrEdS8hJJTZ",

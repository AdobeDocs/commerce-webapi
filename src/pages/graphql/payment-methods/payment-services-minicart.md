## `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation

When you set the payment method to Payment Services in the [`setPaymentMethodOnCart`](../schema/cart/mutations/set-payment-method.md) mutation, the `payment_method` object must contain a `Payment Services` object.

### Payment Services object

The `Payment Services` object must contain the following attributes:

Attribute |  Data Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`payment_source` | String! | The identifiable payment source for the payment method
`payments_order_id` | String! | The unique order id generated in Commerce if Payment Services is enabled after PayPal returns the `paypal_order_id`. Required field for sale transactions
`paypal_order_id` | String! | The unique order id generated by PayPal when receiving the authorization request. Required field for sale transactions
`is_active_payment_token_enabler` | Boolean! | States whether a customer-entered credit/debit card should be tokenized for later usage. Required only if Vaulting is enabled for Payment Services payment integration
`public_hash` | String | The public hash of the payment token. Required field for sale transactions
`location` | String | Defines the origin location for that payment request. Required field for sale transactions

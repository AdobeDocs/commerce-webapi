The schemas documented here are autogenerated from an instance of Adobe Commerce with B2B. Each schema represents a specific user role (Admin, Customer, and Guest) and determines which endpoints are accessible. Use the version switcher to select an Adobe Commerce version and corresponding API.

You can also <a href="https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/rest/quick-reference/generate-local" target="_blank">generate a local API reference</a> based on your own Adobe Commerce configuration, which allows you to see API documentation for your specific Adobe Commerce modules, third-party modules, and extension attributes.

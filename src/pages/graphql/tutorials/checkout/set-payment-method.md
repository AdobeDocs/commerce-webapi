# Step 9. Set the payment method

<InlineAlert variant="success" slots="text" />

You must always set a payment method for an order.

Use the following `cart` query to determine which payment methods which are available for your order.

`{ CART_ID }` is the unique shopping cart ID from [Step 2. Create empty cart](../../tutorials/checkout/add-product-to-cart.md).

For logged-in customers, send the customer's authorization token in the `Authorization` parameter of the header. See [Authorization tokens](../../usage/authorization-tokens.md) for more information.

**Request:**

```graphql
query {
  cart(cart_id: "{ CART_ID }") {
    available_payment_methods {
      code
      title
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cart": {
      "available_payment_methods": [
        {
          "code": "checkmo",
          "title": "Check / Money order"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Set payment method on cart

Use the `setPaymentMethodOnCart` mutation to set the payment method for your order. The value `checkmo` ("Check / Money order" payment method code) was returned in the query.

Send the customer's authorization token in the `Authorization` parameter of the header. See [Authorization tokens](../../usage/authorization-tokens.md) for more information.

**Request:**

```graphql
mutation {
  setPaymentMethodOnCart(input: {
      cart_id: "{ CART_ID }"
      payment_method: {
          code: "checkmo"
      }
  }) {
    cart {
      selected_payment_method {
        code
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

If the operation is successful, the response contains the code of the selected payment method.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "setPaymentMethodOnCart": {
      "cart": {
        "selected_payment_method": {
          "code": "checkmo"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress mutation

The `setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress` mutation assigns the shipping address for the specified negotiable quote. You can assign an address from the company user's address book, or define a new one. The negotiable quote must be in the UPDATED state to successfully set a shipping address.

To return a list of valid shipping addresses, construct a [`company` query](../../company/queries/company.md) that includes the `user` input attribute.

This query requires a valid [customer authentication token](../../../customer/mutations/generate-token.md).

## Syntax

```graphql
{
    setNegotiableQuoteShippingAddress(
        input: SetNegotiableQuoteShippingAddressInput!
    ): SetNegotiableQuoteShippingAddressOutput
}
```
